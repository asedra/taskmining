## 📋 PMI Methodology Integration

The system automatically categorizes user input into PMI knowledge areas:

| PMI Component | Jira Mapping | Auto-Detection Keywords |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| **Vision** | Epic | vision, goal, objective, purpose |
| **Scope** | Epic | scope, boundary, requirement, feature |
| **Deliverable** | Story | deliverable, output, product, result |
| **Milestone** | Story | milestone, deadline, phase, target |
| **Risk** | Task | risk, threat, issue, problem |
| **Dependency** | Task | dependency, prerequisite, needs |

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Basic Project Analysis

```python
from main_pm_assistant import PMAssistantIntegration

# Initialize for your project
pm = PMAssistantIntegration("YourProject")

# Analyze project requirements
result = pm.analyze_user_input("""
We need to build a customer dashboard with real-time analytics.
Critical requirements include sub-second response time and mobile support.
The system must integrate with our existing CRM and handle 10k+ users.
""")

print(f"Generated {result['ideas_generated']} project ideas")
```

### Jira Synchronization

```python
# Sync all ideas with Jira
sync_result = pm.sync_with_jira()

# Sync specific categories only
sync_result = pm.sync_with_jira({
    "category": "risk",
    "priority": "high"
})
```

### Project Documentation

```python
# Generate comprehensive report
report_path = pm.generate_project_report()

# Search project knowledge
results = pm.search_project_knowledge("API integration", include_activity=True)
```

## 🎛️ Configuration

### Environment Setup

Create `.env` file with your Jira credentials:

```bash
JIRA_BASE_URL=your-instance.atlassian.net
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-api-token
JIRA_USERNAME=your-email@domain.com
```

### MCP Configuration

The `.cursor/mcp.json` is pre-configured for Jira integration. To enable:

1. Set environment variables above
2. Install Node.js dependencies: `npm install`
